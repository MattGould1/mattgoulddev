                  <div class="text-caption">
                    Online dating is an amazing tool but often it feels like the
                    tool is misapplied. Which is where
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://spicy.dating"

                    comes from. We want to make online dating great for
                    everyone. There are 3 key areas that we can improve on
                    firstly, the relevancy of matches. We want to help people
                    find the best matches for themselves and often that means
                    getting rid of overly complex algorithms. We use a relevancy
                    based algorithm using OpenSearch. Secondly is communication.
                    We want to help people connect globally and that means
                    bridging a language barrier. Lastly is cost. Online dating
                    is seriously expensive, almost to the point that it seems
                    like a scam. We want to remove the majority of the cost for
                    people genuinely looking to form relationships.

                    <a target="_blank" href="https://dathuis.nl">DatHuis</a> is
                    an automation tool for the Dutch real estate market. It's
                    aimed at real estate agents to help them manage their leads.
                    During my time with DatHuis I worked on the backend
                    architecture using AWS and
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.serverless.com/"
                      >Serverless Framework</a
                    >. It was at DatHuis that I realized the power of serverless
                    technologies like DynamoDB, Lambda and a lot more. The
                    funnest part of working with DatHuis was getting the chance
                    to work with ElasticSearch. I contributed quite a large
                    amount to the ElasticSearch architecture. In the end we were
                    able to have full typescript support based on index mappings
                    (which is totally awesome), automated deployments, with
                    automated index updates and re-indexing.
